			Exploration
		</div>
		<p>With an increased focus on big data, I want to learn more about the ongoing uses of big data in regards to analytics and data visualization. Hoping to start this by familiarizing myself with data visualization tools such as Tableau. In addition to data science, I also plan to gain more experience in web programming through learning AngularJS and ReactJS from Codecademy.</p>

			Brazilian Jiu Jitsu Diary
		</div>
		<p>As a Brazilian jiu jitsu practitioner, there's often way too many techniques that's being taught to ever remember all of them. Although there are a few apps that tackle the problem of having a database of techniques, there aren't many features that allow the practitioners to keep track of what, themselves, have learned - like a diary. I want to create an application that not only has a database of techniques and allows the users to pull videos of the technique, but also include a diary section that keeps track of the date they learned a specific technique, notes for them to take on the technique they learned that day for future references and for self-improvement. This application could become a very powerful tool for grapplers - especially for reviewing techniques and prepping for competitions. With their learned knowledge of the art at their fingertips, they'll be able to create their gameplan based on what they learn and the variety of techniques that worked for them and what didn't work.</p>

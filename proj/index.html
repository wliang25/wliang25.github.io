		</div>

		<p>As a frequent Starbucks drinker, I decided to take a look into what GIS analyzers take into account when determining new Starbucks locations for my final project in Principles of GIS. I used past course lab materials as well as a table of all Starbucks <a href="https://opendata.socrata.com/Business/All-Starbucks-Locations-in-the-World/xy4y-c4mk/data">locations</a> from around the world and census tract data from ArcGIS online for my analysis. I did a comparison between the correlation of population plus stores and median income plus stores. Overall, I concluded that as a multi-billion dollar coffeehouse chain, traffic, population and income were most likely not the only factors that contribute to Starbucks' growth and success in determining locations of future stores.

		<p>Degrees Over Time is a shiny application that takes in data sets from the NCES regarding postsecondary education in the US to analyze trends for popular majors, potentially through a span of time. Through this interactive visualization, we hope to address the concerns of prospective and current college students that don't quite know what they want to do as well as assisting them by showing just how competitive each field of choice is. This visualization will give them a good idea of how much effort they will have to put in to get into the major they choose. Each page within the app strives to tackle each issue raised.</p>

		<p><b>"Keeping Students Safe One Step at a Time"</b></p>
		
		<p>As a female UW student that lives on the UDistrict, walking around late at night might not be the safest choice. But I believe that not only females, but also everyone in general should be able to feel comfortable to take a run at night if they choose to. Me and some classmates decided to tackle this problem by designing a wearable that's not only intuitive to use, but also accessible for our Intellectuals Foundations of Informatics course. Accompanying the wearable was an app for customization and communication within the network of DubSafe users. Through the course, our project obtained the "Honorable Mention" award that was created during the display fair.</p>

		<p>A simple prototype of the mobile application can be found on <a href="https://invis.io/DCAQS51ZB ">InVision</a></p>

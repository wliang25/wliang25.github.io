		<p>As a frequent Starbucks drinker, I decided to take a look into what GIS analyzers take into account when determining new Starbucks locations for my final project in Principles of GIS. I used past course lab materials as well as a table of all Starbucks <a href="https://opendata.socrata.com/Business/All-Starbucks-Locations-in-the-World/xy4y-c4mk/data">locations</a> from around the world and census tract data from ArcGIS online for my analysis. I did a comparison between the correlation of population plus stores and median income plus stores. Overall, I concluded that as a multi-billion dollar coffeehouse chain, traffic, population and income were most likely not the only factors that contribute to Starbucks' growth and success in determining locations of future stores.

		<p>"Keeping Students Safe One Step at a Time"</p>
		<p>As a female UW student that lives on the UDistrict, walking around late at night might not be the safest choice. But I believe that not only females, but also everyone in general should be able to feel comfortable to take a run at night if they choose to. Me and some classmates decided to tackle this problem by designing a wearable that's not only intuitive to use, but also accessible for our Intellectuals Foundations of Informatics course.</p>

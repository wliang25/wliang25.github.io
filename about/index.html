		<p>I was born in Guangzhou, China, but immigrated to the states when I was just a few years old. I've lived in Seattle, Bellevue, Renton, and currently reside in Kent. As such, I speak three languages including English, Cantonese Chinese and Mandarin Chinese.</p>

		<p>Four years later, my brother was born in the states and my twin sisters two years after that. It soon became a very loud yet cozy household in Renton, WA.</p>

		</div>

		<p>I was born in Guangzhou, China, but immigrated to the states when I was just a few years old. I've lived in Seattle, Bellevue, Renton, and currently reside in Kent. As such, I speak three languages including English, Cantonese Chinese and Mandarin Chinese.</p>

		<p>Four years later, my brother was born in the states and my twin sisters two years after that. It soon became a very loud yet cozy household in Renton, WA.</p>

		<p>Attending Oliver M. Hazen High School as a Highlander were the four years that I was super involved with school and decided that I'd have a goal of 400 community service hours by the time I graduated - 100 hours per year. By senior year, I had extra curricular everday of the week after school. I did Key Club on Mondays, Robotics Club (FTC Team: Scarabs 8693) Tuesdays and Thursdays, Wednesday was East Hill Strings Lessons teaching students the violin, and Fridays were STEM club. It was an exciting, fun, and hard four years, but I finished strong.</p>

		</div>

		<p>Growing up as a Seattlite, I followed the path of my favorite color (purple) and decided to attend the University of Washington. I came deciding to become either a computer or mechanical engineer since I enjoyed coding and building stuff as a Scarab in high school. After my freshmen year first quarter, I decided that wasn't quite me because chemistry and physics were definitely not my thing. So I began exploring the world of information sciences including geographic information systems and the iSchool. Today, I am excited to be majoring in Geography, focusing on Information Systems, and double minoring in Informatics and Philosophy. I believe that the knowledge I gain from Geography and Informatics will assist in my passion of learning more about data science and analyzation. The philosophy aspect of my education will help me develop critical thinking that is vital to delivering successful products and services.</p>

			<h1>Hi, I'm Wendy!</h1>
			<h2>STUDENT | GEOGRAPHER | GRAPPLER</h2>
			<p>As a junior at the University of Washington, Seattle, I am interested in multiple aspects of technology and the impacts it has on society. I am majoring in Geography with a focus on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and minoring in Informatics and Philosophy. I work with the <a href="http://hr.uw.edu/hrais/hr-information-systems/">Information Systems team</a> at the HR department of UW as their Student Support Technician. I believe that it is important to have a versatile background when it comes to technology. As such, a future career path that I'd like to pursue would be a Technology Consultant.</p>

			<h1>Hi, I'm Wendy!</h1>
			<p>As a graduating Senior at the University of Washington, Seattle, I am interested in multiple aspects of technology and the impacts it has on society. I am majoring in Geography with a focus on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and minoring in Informatics and Philosophy. I currently work at the iSchool as a Teaching Assistant for INFO201, Technical Foundations of Informatics, where I hold my own quiz section and office hours throughout the quarter. This class covers the languages of R and Markdown including the concepts of using GitHub for version control and using web APIs to generate data visualizations. I believe that it is important to have a versatile background when it comes to technology. Currently scheduled to graduate in June of 2019, I am looking forward to a career in the technology industry as a UI/UX Designer, Technology Consultant, or a Project Manager.</p>

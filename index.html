			<h1>Hi, I'm Wendy!</h1>
			<h2>STUDENT | GEOGRAPHER | GRAPPLER</h2>
			<p>As a junior at the University of Washington, Seattle, I am interested in multiple aspects of technology and the impacts it has on society. I am majoring in Geography with a focus on Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and minoring in Informatics and Philosophy. I work with the <a href="http://hr.uw.edu/hrais/hr-information-systems/">Information Systems team</a> at the HR department of UW as their Student Support Technician. I believe that it is important to have a versatile background when it comes to technology. As such, a future career path that I'd like to pursue would be a Technology Consultant.</p>

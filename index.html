		<p>I am a current junior at the University of Washington. I am interested in the multiple aspects of technology and the impacts it has on society which is why I am majoring in Geography with a focus on Information Systems and minoring in Informatics and Philosophy. I believe that the knowledge I gain from Geography and Informatics will assist in my passion of learning more about data science and analyzation. The philosophy aspect of my education will help me develop critical thinking that is vital to delivering successful products and services.</p>
